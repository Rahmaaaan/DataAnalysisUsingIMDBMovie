# IMDB Movie Data Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring relationships between movie budgets, popularity, runtime, genres, and profitability using the IMDB dataset. This study utilizes Python's data analysis stack to derive insights into film industry trends.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- pandas (v1.2.4+)
- numpy (v1.19.5+)
- matplotlib (v3.3.4+)
- seaborn (v0.11.1+)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Problem Statements

1. **Budget and Popularity:** Is there a relationship between a film's budget and its popularity? Does a higher budget mean higher popularity?
2. **Runtime and Popularity:** How does the runtime of a movie influence audience engagement and popularity?
3. **Popularity and Profitability:** Does higher popularity correlate with higher profits?
4. **Characteristics of Top-Grossing Movies:** What features define the top 10 revenue-generating movies?
5. **Genre Trends Over Time:** Which genres dominate popularity trends over time?
